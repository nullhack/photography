# Photography

Practice is an act of sincere devotion

## How to critique

Comments are most helpful when you can offer analysis that goes beyond “I like that”

* Focus on what you see: shapes, expression, color, texture, contrast
* Discuss the associations and connotations of an image: narrative, light/darkness
* What mood does the image convey?
* What is the style of the image?
* What the image suggests as a whole?
* How does color function?
* Is It denotative (show the essence of an object) or conotative (metaphorical representation)?
* Is It historical? why?
* Is It poetic? Why? Ambiguous (intentionally or not?)? Is It an imagemaking strategy? In what way?
* Color, Shape, Size, Position
* Interpretation based on personal experiences and expertise

### Some points to analyse in photography

* Camerawork: depth of field; sharpness of focus; choice of focus point; time-based blur; lens-based blur (aka “bokah”); stop-action; compression of space resulting from telephoto lens; curvature of field, or barrel distortion, resulting from wide angle lens; vantage point choice; framing; first or second-curtain flash effect.

* Editing: monochrome (black & white); normal, pastel, or highly saturated colors; high or normal or low contrast; burning/darkening of an area of the picture; dodging/lightening of an area of the picture; cropping; frame proportions (square, panoramic, rectangle); graininess or pixilation resulting from low or high ISO choices.

* Composition: vertical; horizontal; symmetry; asymmetry; texture; tone; pattern; line; shape; form; perspective; Golden Mean; dominant feature; positive/negative space; figure/ground relationship; implied line; visual weight.

* Content: category names (such as landscape, still-life, portrait, tableau, documentary, personal symbolism; metaphorical, autobiographical, or others similarly broad); specific subject names that are important to the individual photograph or group of photographs.

## Imagemaking

Hierarchy: In front, foreground, size, group
  * Relational and interpretative
  * Creates order of importance
  
* Scale: Creates hierarchy and dynamic energy in a composition
* Space: Illusion of dimensional space, relationship of the elements to the edges of the screen
* Composition
  * Narrative: Linear, temporal, abstract, metaphoric, descriptions of the moment, action
  * White space/negative space/unoccupied areas
