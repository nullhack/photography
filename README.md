# Photography

Practice is an act of sincere devotion

## Basic elements of photography


* Camera means room (from camera obscura)
* Photograph means light writing
* Vantage point: where is the camera
* Sensor: Full frame (36mm x 24mm), APS-C (25mm x 16mm)
  * Capture light using Red Green Blue sensors (in general Bayer Array 1R, 2G, 1B)
  * CCD (charge couple device): all cells exposed at same time
  * CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor): pixels exposed one at a time
* ISO (International Standards Organization): sensibility of sensor to light
  * Higher -> grainy
* Pixel: Tiny space where light can hit. Picture Element
* White balance: adjust dark/light. Average is grayish
* Crop factor: adjust size between different sizes of sensors (e.g. 1.6x between full frame and APS-C)
* Focal length: Distance between the lens and the sensor
* Normal focal length: Focal length comparable to what we see
* Angle of view for full frame: 
  * 200mm -> 10° (super telephoto -> +zoom)
  * 70mm -> 29° (telephoto -> zoom)
  * 50mm -> 40° (normal angle -> similar to how humans perceive the scene)
  * 16mm -> 97° (wide angle -> smaller image)
* Focal plane: plane in which the light is focused (in general the sensor)
* Out of focus: light is concentrated out of focal plane
* Macro lens: designed for close-up, can achieve higher magnification than life size
* Shutter controls amount of time light will be exposed to the sensor
* Focal plane shutter: a set of two curtains that shield sensor from light
* Apperture (F.stop) : f = focal lenght/diameter of lens
  * In most digital cameras is wide open and closes at the time of exposure
  * LARGER f-stop -> smaller hole
  * Change depth of field (area focused): smaller hole -> bigger depth of field
* RAW file: includes all information captured by the sensors, not only the final image
* Modes of exposure: adjust colors based on environmental lights (shade, sun, lightbulb)
* EVF (electronic viewfinder): in mirrorless camera, mimic viewfinder
* Review time: the amount of time the picture will appear on the rear LCD screen after exposure

## Techniques

* Flash farther from the lens solves red eye
* Adjust white balance on snow, remember average is set to gray
* AI servo -> moving subjects. AI focus AF -> Still then moves
* M-A-P-S, manual, aperture priority, program
* Continuous numbering: continuously number photos even after new folder
* Look for opportunities to have something unexpected
* Camerawork, composition, and concept
* Whenever you think you're really into something that you're looking straight ahead at, go and look at it from the other side
* Whenever you think you're really into something and it's really working well for you in front of you, look behind you

## How to critique

Comments are most helpful when you can offer analysis that goes beyond “I like that”

* Focus on what you see: shapes, expression, color, texture, contrast
* Discuss the associations and connotations of an image: narrative, light/darkness
* What mood does the image convey?
* What is the style of the image?
* What the image suggests as a whole?
* How does color function?
* Is It denotative (show the essence of an object) or conotative (metaphorical representation)?
* Is It historical? why?
* Is It poetic? Why? Ambiguous (intentionally or not?)? Is It an imagemaking strategy? In what way?
* Color, Shape, Size, Position
* Interpretation based on personal experiences and expertise

### Some points to analyse in photography

* Camerawork: depth of field; sharpness of focus; choice of focus point; time-based blur; lens-based blur (aka “bokah”); stop-action; compression of space resulting from telephoto lens; curvature of field, or barrel distortion, resulting from wide angle lens; vantage point choice; framing; first or second-curtain flash effect.

* Editing: monochrome (black & white); normal, pastel, or highly saturated colors; high or normal or low contrast; burning/darkening of an area of the picture; dodging/lightening of an area of the picture; cropping; frame proportions (square, panoramic, rectangle); graininess or pixilation resulting from low or high ISO choices.

* Composition: vertical; horizontal; symmetry; asymmetry; texture; tone; pattern; line; shape; form; perspective; Golden Mean; dominant feature; positive/negative space; figure/ground relationship; implied line; visual weight.

* Content: category names (such as landscape, still-life, portrait, tableau, documentary, personal symbolism; metaphorical, autobiographical, or others similarly broad); specific subject names that are important to the individual photograph or group of photographs.

## Imagemaking

**Photography is more than combining elements of exposure**

For same colors, different configurations lead to different sentiments

Hierarchy: In front, foreground, size, group
  * Relational and interpretative
  * Creates order of importance
  
* Scale: Creates hierarchy and dynamic energy in a composition
* Space: Illusion of dimensional space, relationship of the elements to the edges of the screen
* Composition
  * Balanced composition: in which it appears that the entire scene
has a purpose
  * Narrative: Linear, temporal, abstract, metaphoric, descriptions of the moment, action
  * Negative space/white space/unoccupied areas
